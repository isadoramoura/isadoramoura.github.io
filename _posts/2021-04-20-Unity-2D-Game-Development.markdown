description: To get familiarized with Unity, I created a vertical slice for a 2D Game. The goal is to reach the taxi. </ br> You will face enemies along the way, careful about falling from the buildings of City Rock. You can keep track of the time and beat your scores. More would be included in a real level, such as gems, buffers, enemy variatios and  weapons. </ br> Play the game <a href="https://play.unity.com/mg/other/city-rock-by-isa-moura?fbclid=IwAR2o08rlDB2rNUXxan8BHN2H_NOvJYq5eoBLCVEW_hMQvH4kIhA1EDpQ_vg" target="_blank">here</a>.</ br> All logic coded by me using C# and Unity Engine. Pixel art provided from Unity's free comunity resources but Tile framing organized by me to create the game. Music is from brazilian beat maker <a href="https://soundcloud.com/vcek808/truth" target="_blank">VCEK</a>.
