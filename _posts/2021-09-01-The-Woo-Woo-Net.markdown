description: The Woo Woo Net is a platform that is currently under  construction, sponsored by social entrepreneur, Kimberlee Klein. The platform is dedicated to spiritual healers and clients with a variety of needs seeking spiritual services.</br>It allows healers to post their services and weekly schedule, and clients to book appointments and make payments to healers. This website makes it easier for healers and clients to connect with each other. <p> For this project, I was the main front-end developer and technical writer, meanining I was entirely resposible for writing the use cases and user flows, turning all prototype into code, creating the responsive layout, and making sure that the user interface is well implemented.</p>
