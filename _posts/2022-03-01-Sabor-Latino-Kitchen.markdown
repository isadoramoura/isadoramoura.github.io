description: Product photography, graphics design and website design with Jekyll for Sabor Latino Kitchen, an Empanada focused kitchen located in Vancouver, BC. <p> This collage shows the logo decision making progress. I gave the client different variations for the logo, based on their ideas. The client choose their top 3 variantons, then I removed/added features and colors as needed until the client's expectations were fully met. The last logo is the final Logo.</p>
